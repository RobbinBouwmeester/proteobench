## Community-based benchmark platform for MS-based proteomics data analysis

### Goal
With this project we want to provide a centralized web platform for developers and end-users to compare mass spectrometry-based proteomics data analysis pipelines. This community-curated effort will allow for an easy and controlled comparison of tools developed or used by the participants to other state-of-the-art pipelines for specific applications. The goal is not to select a single best one-fits-all data analysis workflow, but to allow:
end-users to identify a good workflow to fulfill their specific needs
developers to identify the specific strengths and weaknesses in their workflows, guiding the development process
the field to easily position a newly published workflow within the context of the existing state-of-the-art

### Description
Participants (both end-users and developers) can download a set of input files (e.g. raw MS files, search databases, or spectral libraries) tailored to specific benchmark metrics. They can then analyze the data with any workflow, and upload the results in a homogenized format. A set of metrics will be retrieved or calculated from these results and can be visualized alongside all the other benchmarks calculated from the results of other participants (or of curated benchmark runs).
